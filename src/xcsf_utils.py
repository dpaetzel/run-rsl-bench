    """
    Extracts from the given rectangular conditionâ€“based population the lower and
    upper condition bounds.

    Note that center-spread conditions are allowed to have lower and upper
    bounds outside of the input space (e.g. if the center lies closer to the
    edge of the input space than the spread's width). These are fixed by
    clipping the resulting lower and upper bounds at the edges of the input
    space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rules : list of dict
        A list of interval-based rules as created by `sklearn_xcsf.XCSF.rules_`
        (i.e. as exported by `xcs.json(True, True, True)`).
    transformer_X : object supporting `inverse_transform`
        Apply the given transformer's inverse transformation to the resulting
        lower and upper bounds (*after* they have been clipped to XCSF's input
        space edges).

    Returns
    -------
    list, list
        Two lists of NumPy arrays, the first one being lower bounds, the second
        one being upper bounds.
